    "# Crawl Data Analysis: Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook tries various clustering techniques on our web crawl data. It was written for Python 2.7, and assumes it's running on cycles. Note that you will need sklearn >= 0.20 and numpy >= 1.16.0. You can view/edit the notebook remotely as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clone the GitHub repo to cycles (e.g. spin.cs.princeton.edu)\n",
    "- Start up this notebook. Jupyter is not installed globally, but you can install it locally with pip via `pip install --user jupyter`. Then you can run this notebook in a tmux session: `tmux`, then `cd [this directory]`, then `jupyter notebook --no-browser --port 8889` (note that you can choose whatever port number you want, but we'll assume from here on it's 8889). Copy the URL generated - this is the URL you'll visit in your browser to open the notebook. Then Ctrl-B, D to detach the tmux session, and log out of cycles.\n",
    "- On your local machine, forward your local port 8889 to the remote port 8889 on cycles: `ssh -L 8889:localhost:8889 [netid]@spin.cs.princeton.edu`\n",
    "- Now you can open the notebook in your browser by pasting the link you copied earlier."

      "So, you want a scanner that can do it all? The Uniden SDS100 is probably your best bet. There is a learning curve is set a little high if you aren’t already used to using the Sentinel software. The good news is there are plenty of folks on radioreference.com that are willing to guide you through it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SDS100 itself has all the bells and whistles you can imagine. NXDN, DMR, P25 phase I and II, etc.  obviously, you won’t be able to receive encrypted broadcasts. It can even hookup to a GPS receiver if you take it in the road and want to keep up with everything happening nearby.\n",
      "\n",
      "The only downfall is the price tag which Scanner Master has brought down to a price tag that is competitive with any other retailer. You pay for the engineering that went into this technological marvel. There are also the upgrades. For NXDN, DMR, and ProVoice you’ll have to pay a little extra.\n",

      "Secondly, the antenna connector is slightly recessed into the unit.  For those wishing to use aftermarket antennas with higher gain or specific frequencies, you'll need to use an adapter.  \n",

      "It's hard to know where to start, but we'll try. First we should note that Uniden doesn't even call this product a scanner—it’s simply HomePatrol. One reason for this is that unlike so many police scanners, particularly those of recent vintage, HomePatrol is so easy to operate that anyone can use it. You don't have to know a thing about police radio scanners. All you need to do is enter your zip code (or a city name) and the device will autoload the frequencies, alpha tags, trunking systems and sub-audible tones for that area. HomePatrol includes the entire RadioReference.com U.S. and Canadian databases of radio systems. If you travel with HomePatrol, with a special GPS receiver (available from Scanner Master for $89.95), the radio will automatically re-tune itself based on its location (so long as GPS coordinates for the various systems have been entered into the RadioReference databases, which in very many cases they are). This means no more programming!\n",
      "\n",
      "HomePatrol also has a color touch screen, another first in the industry. What we particularly love about this radio is its capacity for hierarchical tuning. You can now tell the radio with just a few clicks: I want to monitor all the agencies in County X, or I want to monitor all the agencies in City Y within County X, or I want to monitor the fire department in City Y. You can go further and state that you only want to scan, for example, Police, EMS and utilities within any group of counties. This allows tremendous flexibility in monitoring, and with the beautiful full-color display it's a pleasure to use.\n",

      "In order for the GPS receiver to connect to the radio you need three additional components: A special Uniden serial cable which includes the proper micro-serial connector to connect to the radio itself and a DB9. Additionally you need a gender-change adapter and a null modem adapter. This GPS accessory kit contains all three components which are then connected to the DB9 jack on the GPS receiver. The reason for this configuration is that the GPS receiver also connects to the Bearcat BCT15X and BCD996XT which requires a standard serial port connection. Note that due to limited production of the serial cable we may at times be out of stock of this kit. Please also note that your everday GPS unit will not work with HomePatrol. This radio requires the antenna for the GPS and must have its own power source. The SpectrumForce GPS receiver along with this accessory kit is exactly what is needed.

I have carried my Packfish 7 and gear over 2 miles to a hidden lake, and I have taken it out in the ocean! It preforms amazingly well on all bodies of water! There is only one thing more impressive than the product, and that is the company behind the product! Sea Eagle stands behind their 3 year warranty, and 180 day refund policy without hesitation and without question! I had an issue with my Packfish 7, so I called Sea Eagle and without any hassle they happily stood by their refund policy! They offered to replace my Packfish 7 with a brand new one right away! I had been contemplating of upgrading to a bigger boat so I asked if I could pay the cost difference and upgrade to the 285 FPB! Sea Eagle agreed with no problem! I love the 285 FPB, but I would more than happily purchase another Packfish 7! It is just that AWESOME! Nothing can compare to the PF7 when it comes to portability! I LOVE ANY SEA EAGLE!\n",

      "My first Sea Eagle SE 330 I bought in the US about 7 years ago and used in the Mediterranian Sea in Turkey every year. I was landing on sharp rocks, sometimes got big waves, sometimes had no time to wash it with fresh water before half year storage. But still, the kayak is working well! I like the quality. But I felt that because of wideness and no footrest this model are pretty slow (if you somehow invent footrests in this models it would be great!). So, I decided to bought Razor Late which is pretty narrow, hard like SUP and fast. It was pretty complicated quest because Sea Eagle does not sell and send boats to Russia, where I live, so I used the help of my US friends and pay extra 200 $ for delivery from NY to Moscow, but finally, I got it! Kayak is really fast as plastic one, very easy to inflate, has comfortable seat and very good backpack. I enjoy the speed of kayak and good quality paddle. Need 2 more metal rings on the backside for dry bags.\n",

      "Purchased SE393RL in January. 5 trips w/more planned. Huntington Harbour, San Diego Mission Bay & Newport Bay/Back Bay. If I wrote this review after one or two trips it would have gotten fewer stars because of folding conundrums being a novice IK owner. I did several frustrating attempts including obligatory living room inflate/deflate & watched the video multiple times. Got caught in a downpour & wanted to get the kayak into the car fast. By not overthinking, just fold fold fold, it all clicked. Since then all successful folds into the bag. PROS:+portability! toss in car, no roof rack/no worries about car height clearance +easy to inflate, a couple minutes even w/basic pump +handles very well in tidal swells or flat water, great length +seat is comfortable & supportive +high weight limit +extra space for the pup. CONS -extra time to clean & get water out of crevices -worthless footrest, not using it -could use extra D-rings front/rear -wish it had inside handle like the SeaEagle Canoe for easier solo carry\n",

      "First of all, I think Sea Eagle boats are the best inflatable boats you can buy. That being said, my first couple of rides in my 393rl were a little sketchy. My previous boat was a paddleski . I bought that about 5 years ago. It was very stable and easy to row. Unfortunatley the wind pushed it around quite a bit. The 393rl has a much lower profile so that reduces that problem a lot. Stability is the problem. I consider myself a pretty good kayaker but I had a hard time feeling secure in this kayak. I guess I just need more time to get used to it. Also , the backpack for the kayak is not the easiest to pack up the kayak. I really struggle to get the kayak back in it. Other than those issues, the boat itself is great. Easy to inflate and deflate. It definitely moves through the water smoothly. I will keep trying to get used to my 393rl but it is definitely suited more for experienced kayakers.\n",

      "The RazorLite™ Kayak's Straight Hull Design\n",
      "\n",
      "An important and unique feature of the RazorLite™ Kayak is its straight hull design which provides the maximum straight hull waterline length. This feature combined with the very narrow kayak width (25\" at the waterline) allows the RazorLite™ to paddle as fast as any rigid kayak. The Bow and stern molds are made of durable plastic and cut through the wind, waves, current, and water like a sharp edge straight razor on a clean close shave. With superior length to width ratio, razor sharp bow entry, straight line planing surface and a precision razor sharp stern exit at the rear these inflatable kayaks are in a performance league of their own.\n",
      "\n",
      "The RazorLite™ Kayak's Unique Bow and Stern Design with Tapered Side Walls\n",
      "\n",
      "The RazorLite™ Kayak's rigid bow and stern molds create the worlds very first speed entry system that leads into a double concave and then opens into a flat planing surface. The double concave design at bow allows pockets of air to enter in between the hull and the water creating lift while reducing friction and drag. The double concave at stern creates a super clean exit. The Tapered Drop Stitch Side Walls provide a rigid chine at the waterline and secondary buoyancy and stability. These features combine to enable the RazorLite™ to glide quickly and effortlessly through the water!\n",
      "\n",
      "Bow and Stern Molds\n",
      "\n",
      "The RazorLite™ Kayak's rigid bow and stern molds create a razor sharp speed entry and exit system. The bow mold cuts through the water effortlessly at a high velocity. The water then meets the carefully designed Tapered Side Walls creating lift while reducing friction and drag, then exits just as fast as it entered at the stern mold leaving little to no wake behind.\n",

This kayak uses 3\" Drop Stitch material for the floor and 4\" Drop Stitch material for the side walls. Our Drop Stitch material uses thousands of high tensile strength threads connecting the top and bottom fabric layers, creating thousands of I-beam supports. This enables the RazorLite™ to be inflated to a much higher pressure (10 psi) than other kayaks (3-4 psi) which increases overall rigidity. The unique Drop Stitch construction makes the RazorLite™ as fast as any rigid kayak in it's class and provides the added benefit of being able to pack in its own backpack. The RazorLite™ is as tough as nails, incredibly rigid, ultra light, and a delight to paddle. U.S. Patent 9,452,809\n",

I've been in the meat cutting business for 45 years, and as you can imagine, I've used allot of different types and styles of sharpening equipment. I have had 3 Norton Multi-Oil Stone units in my lifetime, and then I see this IM83 and I think that this is what I need to carry with me when and wherever I go. I just LOVE this little box full of expertise equipment to keep me sharp and at a razors edge. Thank you for the service, it was fast and easy, and I received it within 3 days of ordering. I know knives and how they work, and I can't wait to start putting that edge on my \"other\" knives I own.\n",

It was a rainy Sunday and I watched every video and read through each article. The information you provided was very helpful in teaching technique and helping me decide what to buy. Also your products are so well thought out, that no matter what stone you prefer (oil, water or diamond), there is a nice package available for a beginner. All of the products you put together each had their own advantages and believe me, each one spent some time in the shopping cart until I made my final decision.\n",
